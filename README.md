A gene search engine iPhone application built on top of the Harmonizome

## Abstract
Several online resources are available that enlist properties of human genes, yet most only include information from a hand full of resources and none provide a user with the same experience for the expanding mobile market. To fill this void, we have expanded the popular Harmonizome web application to include a native interface for the iOS and Android platforms. While the knowledge provided is a just a subset of what is available online, a user has access to 70+ publicly available, categorized resources spanning from expression in cells, tissues, and diseases; regulation by transcription factors, chromatin marks, and microRNAs; functional membership in protein complexes, pathways, and ontologies; genetic association with a disease, and differential expression upon treatment of cells with drugs; as well as structural and other genomic features. Given the increasing popularity and technological advancement of such mobile devices, this application allows for quick access to information related to human genes, increases its user's productivity.
### Implementation and Availability:
The Harmonizome mobile application can be found and downloaded from the [Google Play Store](goo.gl/JWlI8H) for Android devices and [App Store](appstore.com/harmonizome) for iOS devices.
